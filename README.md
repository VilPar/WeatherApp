## Installing

1. you need to have [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. You will need to download the repository
3. open the downloaded folder in Android studio

Then you have 2 options, to run the application on a virtual device or on your own phone.

For the virtual device:

1: Navigate to tools > AVD manager.

2: create a new virtual device (this project is rather old so i recommend to use my settings shown below to avoid any errors but you are welcome to try newer builds if you wish).
